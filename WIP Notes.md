[VOID TASK ]Google Sheet:
Number of signs
Porta Potty
Studio # (if primary artist) -- after studio address on spread sheet (manually added)

[VOID STEPS ]The google sheet  logic needs to be able to accept that 
there may be columns manually added to the google sheet by the user.
When adding data, you need to be adding the "correct" amount of columns. 
and we don't want to over-write the added fields. 
The User plans to add 3 additional fields to the google sheet....

[SOLUTION] WRITE UP: Add to steps for how to do GHOST things: At start of actual tour/when everybody in the google sheet looks ready, Gather the final info: 
Porta Potty?
Studio # (if primary artist) -- after studio address on spread sheet (manually added)
Studio # (if sharing another studio) -- " " (manually added)
